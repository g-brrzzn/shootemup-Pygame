# 👾 Shoot 'em Up - Pygame Engine

> A fully custom, object-oriented vertical Shoot 'em Up built from scratch in Python. It features modular state management, advanced particle physics, dynamic enemy wave generation, and a complete retro arcade aesthetic.

## 📖 About
This project goes beyond a simple game script. It was developed to serve as a robust **2D game engine foundation** using pure Pygame. The architecture relies on strict Object-Oriented principles, separating rendering logic, asset management, and game states.

## ✨ Key Features & Engine Mechanics

The codebase is highly modularized, containing several advanced mechanics built from scratch:

* **Custom State Machine:** Seamless transitions between `Menu`, `Game`, `Pause`, `Options`, and `GameOver` without overlapping logic.
* **Particle Physics System:** Independent modules for environmental effects (`Fall` for rain/stars), combat impacts (`Spark`), and multi-layered CRT-style `Explosion` generators.
* **Dynamic Wave Manager:** The `FormationManager` autonomously handles enemy spawn patterns (V-Shape, Diagonal, Circle Clusters) based on the escalating level difficulty.
* **Asset Manager:** A centralized cache for sprites, sounds, and `.ttf` fonts, including real-time mathematical generation of neon glow surfaces.
* **Entity Scaling:** Automatic internal resolution handling and full-screen toggling.

## 🎮 Controls

The game features standard arcade controls, plus hidden developer keys used for testing game balance:

| Action | Key Bindings |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Move** | `W` `A` `S` `D` or `Arrow Keys` |
| **Shoot** | `Space` |
| **Menu Navigation** | `Up` / `Down` and `Enter` / `Space` |
| **Pause / Back** | `ESC` |
